## Flask Application Design for a Gemini-Powered Newsletter Platform

### HTML Files

- **index.html**: Displays a welcome message and provides a link to the latest issue of the newsletter.
- **newsletter.html**: Presents the collected news articles for the current month.
- **article.html**: Shows the details of an individual news article.

### Routes

**Home Route**

- **URL**: `/`
- **Method**: GET
- **Function**: Renders the index.html file.

**Newsletter Route**

- **URL**: `/newsletter`
- **Method**: GET
- **Function**: Queries the Gemini model for news articles published in the current month, formats them into HTML, and renders the newsletter.html file with the generated HTML.

**Article Route**

- **URL**: `/article/<article_id>`
- **Method**: GET
- **Function**: Accepts an article ID as a parameter, fetches the article details from the Gemini model, and renders the article.html file with the article data.

### Implementation Details

**Gemini Model Integration:** The Flask application will integrate with the Gemini model to retrieve news articles. The specific implementation of this integration will vary depending on the actual configuration of the Gemini model and its API.

**Article Formatting:** The application will need to format the news articles returned by the Gemini model into HTML. This can be done using template engines such as Jinja2 or by manually generating the HTML within the Flask views.

**Pagination:** If the number of news articles in a given month exceeds the capacity of a single newsletter, the application may consider implementing pagination to allow users to navigate between multiple pages of the newsletter.
